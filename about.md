I’m Eric Krause, a photographer based in Metro Detroit, Michigan. I’ve been making images since college—back when film was still the standard—and that tactile process shaped the way I see. Even now, I am still chasing the quiet tension that lives between light and shadow.

My work explores the surreal within the mundane—the moments when familiar places seem to shift, when something just beneath the surface makes reality feel slightly off. I want viewers to feel that unease, that sense of witnessing something that shouldn’t exist. Each photograph is a glimpse through the veil, a brief thinning between this world and another.
